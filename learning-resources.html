        <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
             <h4>Introduction</h4>
             <p>All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the
                Learning Resources and to use the facilities of the Learning Resources 
                for the purpose of their course of study or College employment.</p>

             <p>Membership may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated 
                 from other organisations:  a fee is usually charged. 
                 Access to the Learning Resources for study purposes may be made available
                 to non-members by arrangement.
                 Details are available in the External Services leaflet.</p>

             <p>Use of Learning Resources facilities implies acceptance of the Learning Resources
                 rules printed below.  These are designed to protect the interests of all users
                 of Learning Resources and to ensure that the College operates within the law 
                 and can carry out its functions efficiently and effectively.
                 The Learning Resources rules apply in principle to all Learning Resources 
                 sites, including workstation rooms and site libraries, 
                 notwithstanding some variations in practice in the site libraries. 
                 Admission to the Learning Resources is conditional upon observation of
                 the rules and the staff of the Learning Resources are empowered to enforce
                 them.</p>

             <h4>Rules</h4>
             <h5>A.Access:</h5>

             <p>Users of the Learning Resources are reminded that they must be willing to show  ID cards or other identification
